5.	Use of the Website and the Personal Internet Banking Services <br/>

The Bank shall not be liable for any consequence arising out of any failure to carry out any Instruction due to the inadequacy of funds or credit facility in the relevant Account, provided that if the Bank shall at its sole discretion decide to carry out the Instructions notwithstanding such inadequacy, the Bank may do so without seeking prior approval from or notice to you and you shall forthwith upon demand return the shortfall of fund and shall be fully liable for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred properly together with accrued interests at such rate as maybe prescribed by the Bank as a result of the overdraft, advance or credit thereby created. For the avoidance of doubt, any Instruction given to the Bank shall operate only as a request to the Bank to act on such Instruction, and the Bank, in its sole discretion and without giving any reason or assuming any liability, may refuse to act on such request or any part thereof immediately or at all. <br/>
 
5.8	Notwithstanding Clause 5.7, the Bank may (but is not obliged to) withdraw or deduct such sums of money, including any related costs and expenses, from any Account(s) (whether or not it would result in any Account being overdrawn) as shall be required to complete any Transaction. <br/>
 
5.9	The Bank may (but is not obliged) to act on any Instruction that the Bank, in its sole discretion, believes to have been given or authorised by you (whether or not such Instruction was in fact given or authorised by you). The Bank shall be under no duty to verify the validity or authenticity of any Instruction once your correct Login Name and PIN have been inputted to gain access to or use the Personal Internet Banking Services. The Bank is entitled to treat such Instruction as having duly authorised and approved by you. Subject to Clause 5.5, you will indemnify the Bank against all costs, expenses, losses and damages which it may suffer or sustain arising out of or in connection with any Instruction. <br/>
 
5.10	You acknowledge that the Personal Internet Banking Services are provided as an additional service or channel to receive instructions from you, and shall not be considered as a substitute for other accepted methods of giving instructions. You will use other methods or channels to give instructions to the Bank if the Personal Internet Banking Services are not available. <br/>
 
5.11	Messages sent through the Personal Internet Banking Services shall be treated as if they were made in writing and signed by the sender. The parties waive any right to contest the validity or enforceability of a contract effected through the Personal Internet Banking Services on the ground that it was effected electronically. <br/>
 
5.12	As between the parties, a contract effected through the Personal Internet Banking Services is concluded in Hong Kong and at the time when the Bank's final confirmation (showing a transaction number) of your Instruction is dispatched by the Bank's computer system. If you do not receive such confirmation, you must subsequently check via the Personal Internet Banking Services. <br/>
 
5.13	You will not use or permit the use of the Website or the Personal Internet Banking Services in whole or in part for any purpose, other than to gain access to the Accounts, to carry out Transactions, to make enquiries relating to the Accounts or to obtain other related services which the Bank may at its sole discretion provide from time to time. In particular, but without limitation, you will not and will not procure or knowingly allow any other person to: <br/>
 	
(a)	disrupt or interfere with the Website, the Personal Internet Banking Services or any software, hardware or equipment connected to the Website or the Personal Internet Banking Services; <br/>
(b)	violate any Applicable Law relating to your use of the Website or the Personal Internet Banking Services; or <br/>
(c)	collect or store any information about the Bank, other users of or parties to the Website or the Personal Internet Banking Services other than those of the Accounts. <br/>
 
5.14	You shall as soon as reasonably practicable notify the Bank by telephone at such telephone number and, if required by the Bank, then followed in writing to such address of the Bank as may be designated by the Bank from time to time, or in person at one of the Bank's branches if you find or believe that your Computer System, Login Name or PIN has been compromised, lost or stolen, or that any unauthorized transaction has been conducted over any Account. Upon confirmation of the authenticity of such notification to the satisfaction of the Bank, the Bank may at your cost (if appropriate) suspend the use of your Login Name or PIN and, at its sole discretion, re-issue a new Login Name or PIN to you. Subject to Clause 5.5, you will remain wholly responsible for all fees, costs, expenses, losses and damages incurred by or in connection with the use of the Personal Internet Banking Services, the Content and/or the Website by any unauthorised third party which is caused by your failure to comply with your obligations under these Personal Internet Banking Services Terms and Conditions until such time as the Bank has received and accepted your notification. If no effective or convenient means of notification for this purpose are made available by the Bank to its customers at the time when you should notify the Bank, you shall notify the Bank within a reasonable time after such means have become available again. For the avoidance of doubt, you will not be liable for losses and damages incurred after the Bank's confirmation of its actual receipt and acceptance of your notification but without prejudice to your liability (if any) with respect to the loss and damage incurred before such confirmation by the Bank has been given to you. You agree and acknowledge that the Bank is entitled to reasonable time for processing your notification prior to its confirmation. <br/>
 
6.	Fees and Charges <br/>
 
6.1	The Bank reserves the right to impose fees and charges in relation to the Personal Internet Banking Services and to revise such fees and charges from time to time by giving written notice to you provided such written notice shall be given to you at least 30 days before the revised fees and charges take effect unless such change is not within the Bank's control. You shall be bound to pay all fees and charges, in the amounts, manner and times determined by the Bank, if you use the Personal Internet Banking Services, or maintain any Account, after the effective date of any fee or charge or its revision. <br/>
 
7.	Two-Factor Authentication <br/>
 
7.1	The Bank may specify from time to time the Transactions which are required to be verified and authorized by two factors authentication after your logon to Yan Shi Personal Internet Banking Services and/or Mobile Banking Services. <br/>
 
7.2	By requesting the Bank to conduct a Transaction which requires any authentication by SMS OTP, you shall be deemed to have irrevocably authorized the Bank to transmit the SMS OTP, through any telecommunication service provider or any other third party, by means of a SMS text message to the mobile phone number that you have registered with the Bank, or any other means approved by the Bank, (a) specified or accepted from time to time by the Bank or (b), where permitted by the Bank, changed subsequently by you and accepted by the Bank. You shall register a mobile phone number or an alternative channel of communication accepted by the Bank to which one-time passwords may be transmitted to you. You shall notify the Bank timely before such registered mobile phone number or channel will be changed. You agree that the Bank may display details of the Transaction in a message sent to such registered mobile phone number or channel. <br/>
 
7.3	By requesting the Bank to conduct a Transaction with authentication by a Mobile Token through a mobile device that you have registered with the Bank, you shall be deemed to have irrevocably authorized the Bank to accept and confirm your authentication and identity verification. <br/>
